  ## Description

  Flasher is a full-stack web application that serves as a flashcard study companion for Bootcamp students. Drawing inspiration from similar products like Quizlet, Flasher allows the user to navigate through decks of flashcards pertaining to their current area of study all the way from basic HTML to the popular Javascript library React. Users also have the ability to "favorite" specfic cards for further review and even create new cards in their personal deck.

  ## Usage

  This can be used to quickly create readme templates without having to start from scratch every time! <br>
  The template includes sections for: <br>

  - Title of your project
  - Table of contents
  - Description 
  - Usage
  - Contributions
  - Tests
  - License, if you choose to use one
  - Contact section containing a link to your github and email<br>

  After running the command "node index" in your terminal, the program will give you a series of prompts. When you've answered all of the prompts, it will generate a filled out README template for your project.
